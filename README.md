# Mesh Heal add-on for Blender 2.79+

## Introduction

This [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) add-on includes additional routines for healing meshes, such as Recalculate Normals, Fill Holes and Clean Mesh (to convert non-manifold mesh into manifold while minimizing destructive operations). By default, Blender contains many routines that are meant for these tasks. Unfortunately, Blender's default routines don't always work right when mesh quality is bad enough, mesh errors are specific, or mesh contains many errors.

## Recommendations

- First try to use Blender's default routines to heal your mesh. Especially, please check the official "3D Print Toolbox" add-on, which contains many mesh healing and analysis functions.
- If Blender's default routines fail, try the routines in this add-on.

## Warnings

- Routines are very unstable and WIP, use at your own risk.
- Routines are slow.
