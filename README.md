# Mesh Heal add-on for Blender

## Introduction

Mesh Heal is an add-on for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). It includes additional Blender operators for healing surface meshes. By default, Blender contains many routines that are meant for these tasks. Unfortunately, Blender’s default routines don’t always produce good results in some difficult cases. Specifically, I run into problems when I was trying to convert non-manifold isosurfaces into manifold surfaces with consistent face normals appropriate for volumetric rendering.

## Documentation

Documenatation is located in the doc folder in the add-on sources. You can also [view documentation in github html preview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkeskita/mesh_heal/master/doc/html/mesh_heal.html).
